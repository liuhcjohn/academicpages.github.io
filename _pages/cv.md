Education
======
* B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, December 2021
  * Dean's Academic Achievement Award

Work experience
======
* March 2023 – Present: Mechanical Quality Engineer
  * Apple Inc. | Battery Cell & Pack | AirPods & iPad
  * Led the redesign of battery pack components on the M3 iPad Air to eliminate battery tab crack, enhancing product reliability and safety, through assessing the system MCO based on the tolerance analysis and cell cycling data
  * Lifted quality alert on ~1M Airpods Pro 2nd gen Case due to pouch breach risk by lowering the DPPM, finding root cause to vendor's in house cell pouch punching die tool and recreating the failure mode
  * Spearheaded a $500K cost-saving initiative over the Airpods 4th gen production lifetime by optimizing metrology equipment across multiple vendors through JMP simulation results, utilizing NPI build and MP legacy data
  * Improved battery pack yield by 25% on the Airpods Pro 2nd gen buds by qualifying two new tag vendors and validating a new tag coating material through wetting balance soldering tests
  * Increased pack yield by 50%, saving $600k through the Airpods 4th gen production lifetime by redesigning the cosmetic tape release liner to fix an in process tape warpage issue and qualifying a second die-cut vendor

* April 2022 – March 2023: Manufacturing Design Engineer
  * Apple Inc. | Thermal Modules | iPhone
  * Qualified a second source vendor and led the development of an improved B-PET material for chemical and abrasion resistance properties, resulting in $1.5M savings over iPhone 15 and 15 Pro lifetime
  * Enhanced production line efficiency from 30% to 60% resulting in a cost savings of $180k/line by driving the DFM and developing die-cut automation for new material, waste material and finished good material removal
  * Developed a new synthetic graphite width by optimizing the sintering temperature profile through running TGA, SEM and DOE studies to support NPI programs for the Display team

* June 2021 – September 2021: Body Structures Engineer Intern
  * Rivian
  * Developed engineering reports to drive future battery pack design by analyzing existing battery pack structures and presenting design recommendations to resolve current issues in manufacturability, complexity, and efficiency
  * Redesigned the torque box to optimize for mass and assembly efficiencies (Reduced mass by 40% and number of components to two) by analyzing the critical load paths through each component in small overlap crash test
  * Contributed to NPI project by establishing the design direction for a new pickup structure by benchmarking competitor designs through a Pugh chart

* September 2020 – March 2021: Dimensional Engineer Intern (Body in White)
  * Tesla
  * Reduced production downtime and improved dimensional issues within tooling for Model Y front underbody assembly (FUB) by creating drawings in CATIA and validating a 4-way pin and pad detail redesign
  * Developed a data analysis tool for Model S/X/Y to detect location of highest dimensional issue within an assembly and to visualize data from metrology by implementing macros in Excel
  * Corrected dimensional issues to fall within 10% of tolerance in the Model 3/X/Y underbody by understanding part datum structure and assembly mating type to adjust locating pins in geo fixtures using data from metrology
